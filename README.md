1.How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Answer: Interpreting user needs allows you listen and understand what a user would like to see in a specific program based off of their opinion. User stories help with this by getting detailed information about the suggested feature, and this then helps devlopers and testers understand what you specifically would like to see in the program.

2.How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
An approach to take when devloping programs is to gather user stories, create a project backlog and rank deliverables in order of priority, as well as create sprints to develope the program. These are some of the must have agile processes in a development project.

3.What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I think being a good team member requires you to be collaborative, tentetive, and willing to compromise in certain situations. Agile is a specific framework, and someone not willing to learn the processes of the agile framework would be a bad team member.
